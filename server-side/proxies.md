# Proxies downsides

You need to assume that if you use some other user's infrastructure, you're accepting that required maintenance and proxy downtime may occur. You may want to go by the [host your own](#host-your-own-proxy) route. 
Mobile platforms use the initial streamer.m3u8 ad block system, thus making that once you get the first request done, you no longer need that proxy working unless you switch between streamers. TTV LOL PRO V2 for example uses HTTP proxies, and it is required to have the server running all the time to not have buffering issues, thus making it much costly.

Consider giving your support by covering some of their infrastructure costs via donations if you feel they do a great job. You would have to pay 12â‚¬ / month to Twitch if amazing people in the community didn't spend their time looking for circumventions.
